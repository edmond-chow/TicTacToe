# TicTacToe
A game you can be an Attacker or Defender, as a User you may put an O chess
while as a Response the program might put an X chess. Which of the roles also
gives you a chance to simulate within various cases in Debug mode. The code
enumerates a course of options, the Modes are encoded in the 2-bit field from a
32-bit type Board, and the one exceeding 2-bit is treated as a control code to
NewGame. The Startup code intends to just reset the game without switching into
other encoded Mode. The Conjugate Side switches in between Attacker or Defender
while the Conjugate Form may on or off the Debug mode when you press the key D
or Escape. The Conjugate Side combining the Conjugate Form reproduces 4 scene,
which of those can further jump in Bonus Scene or Clumsy Scene, where you press
the key W or L. Whenever you press the key Escape, you will ultimately get in
the original scene you held.
